## üìñ About the Project

This project is a **Web Scraping** service for *AnimeFLV* to obtain all the episodes of One Piece and subsequently their IFrame tag depending on the selected player.

## üß† Algorithm

- Lists all episodes by taking the most recent one from the AnimeFLV page.
- The episodes that are not obtained in the first scraping (because the web generates them as you scroll) are manually generated in the JSON response by the controller `getepisodecontroller.js` following the logic of the previous ones.
- When a controller is selected, the link of the same is entered and the main IFrame is obtained.
- If the main player does not work, the others can be obtained by scraping the option tags to get the IFrame according to the selected option.
- Search, pagination, and sorting buttons have been implemented for better organization of the episodes. This also prevents the page from being overloaded.
